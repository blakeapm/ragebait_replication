KEYWORDS: Bereavement, child protection, domestic homicide, femicide, foster care, intimate partner violence, qualitative research, traumatic grief, uxoricide
There was substantial variation in children‚Äôs perspectives; we found both positive and negative stories on almost any topic. In that sense, an over-arching theme of ‚Äòunique perspectives‚Äô emerged. We describe children‚Äôs viewpoints on the three main spheres they talked about: themselves, their biological parents, and their wider (family) environment.","While most participants were fairly content with themselves and their living arrangements, they also expressed substantial and persistent difficulties, including distress, conflicts between family members, and feelings of unsafety. Most importantly, children‚Äôs self-image, their perspectives on their biological parents, and their views on their broader (family) environment varied considerably from participant to participant, and also between siblings.

Conclusions: It is unlikely that straightforward guidelines can be given with regard to where the children should live after parental homicide, or whether they should be in contact with the perpetrating parent. Rather, this study‚Äôs findings underline the need to explore children‚Äôs individual viewpoints carefully during decision-making processes.

form of juvenile victimization, have
received a great deal of deserved publicity

statistics on juvenile murder victims are

data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation‚Äôs

Reports (SHRs), which are part of the

in the United States. This rate is

"The primary demand of protestors in Ferguson, MO, is the prosecution of the police officer who shot and killed an unarmed African-American teen, Michael Brown. Not only protestors on the street, but elected African-American officials and activists like Jesse Jackson are also demanding the immediate arrest, and quick trial, of the officer. These public officials and figures often predict that the policeman will be convicted of one or another variety of homicide.

The history of the prosecution of alleged perpetrators of violence against African-American victims brought about with heavy public and political pressure hasn‚Äôt been good for the alleged victims and those who conducted the prosecution.","Data were obtained for 44 countries.

Acquaintances committed 12.6% (5.9‚Äì31.3) of child homicides. Almost a tenth (9.2% (IQR 0.0‚Äì21.9) of child homicides had missing information on the perpetrator. The largest proportion of parental homicides of children was found in high-income countries (64.2%; 44.7‚Äì71.8) and East Asia and Pacific Region (61.7%; 46.7‚Äì78.6). Parents committed the majority (77.8% (61.5‚Äì100.0)) of homicides of children under the age of 1 year. For adolescents, acquaintances were the main group of homicide perpetrators (36.9%, 6.6‚Äì51.8).

"A study featured in a forthcoming manuscript on DARVO suggests that, yes, perpetrators influence people with this tactic. Participants in this study read about an incident of domestic violence, along with statements from a fictional perpetrator and victim. The perpetrator either remorsefully acknowledged the abusive behavior, or they used DARVO to discredit the victim and deny their abuse. Participants in the DARVO condition rated the victim less credible, more responsible for the abuse, and more abusive. What‚Äôs more, participants judged the perpetrator less responsible for the abuse and less abusive. All participants read the same victim statement and description of the assault‚Äîthe only reason participants rated the victim less favorably (and the perpetrator less harshly) was because of DARVO.

","Domestic Homicide Reviews (DHRs) are completed following domestic homicides. They provide multi-agency accounts of families living with domestic violence and abuse (DVA) and their interactions with services. This study addressed children‚Äôs involvement in domestic homicide. We analysed all DHRs where there were children under eighteen among those published in 2011‚Äì16. This yielded a sub-sample of fifty-five DHRs from a total of 142 reports. The extent of children‚Äôs exposure to homicide varied, with some directly witnessing the homicide, viewing the aftermath or calling for help. DHRs provided limited information on children‚Äôs needs or their future care and children were only rarely involved in the review process itself. Nearly a third of reports identified that children had previous experience of DVA and contact emerged as a means of sustaining control and intimidation. There was evidence of blinkered vision among professionals who missed indicators of DVA and failed to engage with perpetrators or listen to children. Practitioners need training and assessment tools that direct their attention onto children and knowledge of resources that enables identification of need and appropriate referrals. Law and practice should address children‚Äôs involvement in the DHR process and the risks embedded in child contact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7NXH,Bot

"Perpetrators of violence often use a strategy of Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender (DARVO) to confuse and silence their victims. Although some previous research has examined the individual elements of DARVO, this is the first study to directly examine DARVO as a unitary concept and to investigate how it relates to feelings of self-blame among victims. Subsequently, 138 undergraduate students were asked to report on a time they confronted an individual over a wrong-doing. DARVO was assessed with a new measure constructed for this study. Analyses revealed that:  DARVO was commonly used by individuals who were confronted;  women were more likely to be exposed to DARVO than men during confrontations;  the three components of DARVO were positively correlated, supporting the theoretical construction of DARVO; and higher levels of exposure to DARVO during a confrontation were associated with increased perceptions of self-blame among the confronters",A systematic review of 9431 studies derived from 18 databases led to the inclusion of 126 studies after double screening.
