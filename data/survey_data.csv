I have to admit that I perceive muslims as being idealistic in their attitudes about acceptable behavior, and I can easily envision a scenario where a (presumably American) child may've mouthed-off to the ""middle-aged muslim refugee"" who then reacted with a physical slap that then got out of control. I can just as easily envision the reaction of the residents crowding in on the perpetrator as being very likely. I'm sure we all agree that one of the foremost challenges concerning immigrants is that, when a person immigrates into America, they bring their culture with them.
