Topic 1 & at least twenty words? You do know my reaction can be summed up as "Meh" right? Also, word counting is fucking annoying, stop doing this. what part of "I don't actually care" did you not get the first time you asked something like this? Also, word counting is annoying, stop doing it in surveys. & 1.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\ 
  Topic 1 & everyone was shocked by the gruesome homicide of the child. most commenters were understandably upset in reaction to reading the news about the child's homicide. I wouldn't know what to do if someone hurt my child or one of my nieces or nephews. i am not a violent person but if the unthinkable happens i don't know how i would react honestly. & 1.00 & 0.00 & 1.00 \\ 
  Topic 2 & I am left with more questions than objective feelings. How did this happen and why? I hope that the family of the deceased child receives help. Perhaps the article should have noted places that help others in a crises and how to aid with money or volunteering.  I wonder if he did it. I wonder if his identity was not mistaken. I wonder if two innocent people were now harmed or dead. & 0.00 & 1.00 & 1.00 \\ 
  Topic 2 & That's one of the most unemotionally written articles I've came across in quiet a while. Most articles are written in a way to elicit feelings of emotion from it's audience. The behavior of the accused is deplorable but the author didn't present it that way. It seemed to be more focused on the attack against the accused. As I stated before, this is one of the most unemotional articles I've ever came across. It is straight and to the point. Straight, no chaser. & 0.00 & 1.00 & 0.00 \\ 
  Topic 3 & My thoughts are of sadness. When I have no control over any situations I tend to try to "let go let God". I pray. I prayed for all involved in this very sad situation. What comes to my mind is "who am I to throw the stone". I am not perfect and no one on this earth is perfect. When given the right mix or right circumstances and timing we all have failed in the approcated reactions and actions. We all sin at some point or points in our lives.  Very sad thoughts. I do not think an eye for an eye is the best way to handle violence of any kind. We live by a gun we die by a gun. We live by violence we die by violence. We should evolve as spiritual human beings and evolve in a way that becomes peaceful and nonviolent.   & 0.00 & 1.00 & 1.00 \\ 
  Topic 3 & We need to depend on law enforcement to deal with crime. lawlessness will bd the result if we let ordinary citizens deal with criminals. We can not allow ordinary citizens attack people even if they are criminals. That is what our justice system is for. & 1.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\ 
  Topic 4 & There was not much detail given on the actual homicide, but any killing of a child is unjustified. Children are defenseless and to murder one is an act of cruelty and brutality. I do not fault the neighborhood members for tracking the man down. I think the people were justified in how they reacted, though maybe vigilante justice is not always the most prudent course of action. However, in the heat of the moment, it is understandable why they did it. I do not think they should face any serious punishment, assuming the man they beat was actually the perpetrator. & 1.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\ 
  Topic 4 & The reporting in the article was quite poor, it made it unclear how the child was killed, what the circumstances regarding the case were, and how the identity of the suspect was released broadly enough for a gang of vigilantes to attack the suspect, so it is difficult to form any significant reaction to the events described in the article. As indicated in my previous response, it was unclear how the vigilantes managed to locate the alleged criminal, and it seems obvious that there is the distinct possibility that an innocent person was set upon by mob justice. & 0.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\ 
  Topic 5 & The stresses caused by our economic system manifest in dysfunctional family life and twisted values when everything a person witnesses from early life is obviously unfair. People grow up scarred by deprivation of healthy social interaction and commit crimes that the average person cannot fathom. It is too big a leap for most to read of a brutal child-killing and be able to connect the incident to inequality.  People under great stress revert to early learned behavior when they themselves find themselves in acute stress, especially within a backdrop of chronic stressors. If a man's father behaved violently under stress, chances are, unless instructed otherwise, that man will immitate the behavior models with which he is familiar. He will not have developed the skills to work through frustration constructively. Punishing people does nothing constructive beyond fufilling a social and cultural urge to feel that there can be justice, although the public perception of what justice is remains entrenched in the application of obsolete ideas from both religion and socio-political philosophy. Once people's basic needs are guaranteed, the release of positive energy will finally enable society to have the courage to seriously re-examine our economic system. & 1.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\ 
  Topic 5 & This act shows the disgusting mentality of some very narrow minded citizens. I fear that these types of incidents will only increase due partly to the political climate of the times. I feel this is a disgusting and cowardly act perpetrated by a probably narrow minded buffoon. I feel like acts such as this will escalate due to the current political climate.  & 0.00 & 1.00 & 0.00 \\ 
  Topic 6 & I am immediately very suspicious of the refusal to tell us anything about the supposed perpetrator. I suspect he is some "vibrant diversity" as is the usual case when the media chooses not to report anything about him. If it's a White male, the media sticks that in the HEADLINE with breathless glee--sometimes even when it isn't actually a White male but they are fairly sure they can convince us he is one with a doctored photo. This is because people are sick and tired of seeing criminals fawned over, provided for, excuses made for them, and the police doing essentially nothing to address actual issues. At worst the guy gets free housing, food and medical care forever--meanwhile the child gets to lose his or her entire future and so do the parents. It's about time we started defending ourselves, since clearly no one else is going to do it for us. & 0.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\ 
  Topic 6 & I immediately thought about the fact that people are jumping the gun as they are attacking an 'alleged' perpetrator. I got the impression that people are scared and are playing into their prejudices too much. I would want to hear a more solid confirmation of events before making any further decisions. I seriously thought people were jumping the gun by attacking the alleged perpetrator without any further confirmation. Playing to such base desires without evidence disgusted me a bit. I really want to see more confirmations of the story before any further decisions. & 0.00 & 1.00 & 1.00 \\
